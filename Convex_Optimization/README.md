# Convex Optimization 

This folder contains the different assignments required as part of the *Convex Optimization* course given by the Pr. Alexandre D'ASPREMONT.

## [Lab 1: LASSO](https://github.com/HalvardBariller/MVA/tree/main/Convex_Optimization/LASSO)

Solving the LASSO optimization problem by implementing a Barrier method (using Newton's algorithm) to solve the dual problem under the form of a Quadratic Program.
